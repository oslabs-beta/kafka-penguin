# FailFast

This strategy executes a purposeful disconnect after a producer has sent an erroneous message.  Potential use cases for this strategy include micro-services where there is a low tolerance for failure, as well as acid and/or transactional workflows. This strategy also works well for development environments in Agile-based workflows. 

## Syntax:

#### FailFast\(retries, kafka-client\)

`retries` Number of times the producer attempts to send the message before disconnecting and throwing an error.

`kafka-client`  A configured  [KafkaJS client](https://kafka.js.org/docs/configuration) provided by the developer. 

**Producer**

`FailFast.producer` Returns a producer initialized from the strategy instance. The producer has "adapted" methods that execute the strategy under the hood. 

`producer.connect`  Connects the producer to the Kafka cluster indicated in the configured KafkaJS client. 

`producer.send(message)` This method takes in one argument, `message` that is passed in with the same requirements as the counterpart method on KafkaJS, and sends it to the Kafka cluster. However, this `send` will disconnect the producer once it reaches the set number of retries. 

## Example:

**FailFast**

```javascript
import { FailFast } from 'kafka-penguin'
const FailFastClient = require('./clientConfig.ts')

// Set up Fail Fast with the number of retried and a configured KafkaJS client
const exampleFailFast = new FailFast(2, FailFastClient)

// Initialize a producer from the new instance of Fail Fast
const producer = exampleFailFast.producer();


// Example error of a producer sending to a non-existent topic
const message = {
  topic: 'topic-non-existent',
  messages: [
    {
      key: 'hello'
  ]
}

// FailFast will attempt to send the message to the Kafka cluster.
// After the retry count is reached, the producer will automatically disconnect and an error is thrown.
producer.connect()
  .then(() => console.log('Connected!'))
  .then(() => producer.send(message))
```
